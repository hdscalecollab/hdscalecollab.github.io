  bio:   Marta Jankowska is an Associate Professor in Population Sciences at the Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Cancer Center in Los Angeles, CA. As a health geographer, she is interested in most everything to do with spatial aspects of health and has a wide-ranging research agenda. In particular, she is passionate about merging multi-levels of health data from the microbiome and omics to biomarker outcomes, to health behaviors, to environmental exposures and structural racism policies. She is also interested in the use of sensor data for fine-scaled exposure measurement.

  email: nnukavarapu@coh.org
  bio :  I have completed my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, India in Geocomputation. My research interest lies in the intersection of Geographic information systems and Artificial intelligence (GeoAI), and in this space, I build GeoAI-based models to understand the risk, vulnerabilities, and scalability of complex spatiotemporal operations and health outcomes in the health sector. At present, my area of research work is developing GeoAI-based models integrating mHealth (Mobile Health) data, biomarkers, socio-demographic factors, environmental exposures, and satellite imagery-derived variables. This would help in understanding different health outcomes and in developing customized mHealth-based interventions. In my free time, I love reading about history and listening to Bollywood music.
