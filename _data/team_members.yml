  bio:   Marta Jankowska is an Associate Professor in Population Sciences at the Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Cancer Center in Los Angeles, CA. As a health geographer, she is interested in most everything to do with spatial aspects of health and has a wide-ranging research agenda. In particular, she is passionate about merging multi-levels of health data from the microbiome and omics to biomarker outcomes, to health behaviors, to environmental exposures and structural racism policies. She is also interested in the use of sensor data for fine-scaled exposure measurement.

  email: vle@coh.org, vivienl@usc.edu
  bio :  I am a third-year graduate student at the University of Southern California, where I am pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Public Health concentrating on GeoHealth. I am focusing on how geographic arrangement links people, places, social and economic factors, and cultural values with the well-being of individuals and communities. I intend to apply the knowledge and skills learned about the spatial examination of data to emphasize health inequalities in my professional career.
