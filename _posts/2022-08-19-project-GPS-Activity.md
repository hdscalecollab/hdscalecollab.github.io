A significant hurdle in the development of methodologies and advancement of theory regarding data types used for answering question about energy and spatial context (such as the integration of GPS, accelerometer, and GIS) is turning large data sets collected from sensors into usable values for epidemiologic statistical models, dealing with data error and missingness, as well as integrating diverse types of sensor data and environmental exposures.

The published papers below provide a well cited framework for using these types of data. Additionally, these methods are being used in research studies, advancing the science in exposure and exposome research by developing more precise estimates of environmental exposure for individuals moving through space and time.
