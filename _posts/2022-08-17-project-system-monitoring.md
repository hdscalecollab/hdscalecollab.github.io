​​These papers focus on recent research centered on cancer-related health disparities, with a specific focus on data integration of large geospatial datasets with a range of omics and clinical outcomes. The challenge of this research area is understanding the complexity of the diseases, particularly through the lens of health disparities. Recent d, biomarkers, etc. are expanding our understanding of how the human genome and human body fit into a larger system of factors that play a complex role in the development of cancer. Simultaneously, increased specialization into these fields makes systematic models that integrate and span these advances more challenging. The papers below are a contribution to the development of systems approaches to understanding health disparities, with attempts to model multiple levels of exposure and omics within a single model.
