Machine learning methods are increasingly permeating various scientific disciplines as well as popular science. However, there are significant hurdles to applying these methods into public health and behavioral health ranging from basic terminological literacy, ideal methods, ground truth and training datasets, integration of health theory into computer science models, data security, dealing with spatial data, and other challenges.

These papers introduce new software infrastructure developments that have led to discovery and methodologies for data integration in the field. Additionally, several MIL models for predicting behaviors from sensor data have been successfully developed and are beginning to develop models from these data sets to predict health behaviors like fast food purchasing.
