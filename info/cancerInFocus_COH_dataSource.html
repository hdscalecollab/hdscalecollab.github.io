      <p style='text-align: justify;'>Data for Cancer InFocus were gathered from several publicly available sources. Due to automated data collection efforts, years on sources will change over time. The years given here represent the most recently available data and reflect what is found on <a href="https://cancerinfocus.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer InFocus: Catchment Areas</a>. The exact years available in a specific cancer center's Cancer InFocus application may vary depending on how recently the responsible institution has updated them. </p>

    <h2><strong><em>Cancer Incidence and Mortality</em></strong></h2>

    <h4><a href="https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State Cancer Profiles (SCP)</a></h4>

    <p>SCP is an interactive map engine produced in collaboration between the National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was developed with the idea to provide a geographic profile of cancer burden in the United States and reveal geographic disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, risk factors for cancer, and cancer screening, across different population subgroups. The target audiences are health planners, policy makers, and cancer information providers who need quick and easy access to cancer related data and maps to inform and prioritize investments in cancer control.</p>

    <p>Cancer incidence data from SCP used in Cancer InFocus comes from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results SEER*Stat Database and from the National Program of Cancer Registries where applicable. The most recently available incidence data are the 5-year average age-adjusted rates per 100,00 people for 2015-2019.</p>

    <p>Cancer mortality data from SCP used in Cancer InFocus comes from the National Vital Statistics System public use data file. The most recently available mortality data are the 5-year age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 people for 2016-2020.</p>

    <p>PLACES is a collaboration between CDC, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the CDC Foundation. PLACES provides health data for small areas across the country. This allows local health departments and jurisdictions, regardless of population size and rurality, to better understand the burden and geographic distribution of health measures in their areas and assist them in planning public health interventions.</p>

    <p>PLACES provides model-based, population-level analysis and community estimates of health measures to all counties, places (incorporated and census designated places), census tracts, and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) across the United States.</p>

    <p>Cancer InFocus uses the indicator Public Water Systems Violations (Health Based) from the SDWIS. This data is aggregated from the most recently completed year back to 2016.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://enviro.epa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EPA Envirofacts</a></h4>

    <p>The Envirofacts Multisystem Search integrates information from a variety of databases and includes latitude and longitude information. Each of these databases contains information about facilities that are required to report activity to a state or federal system.</p>

    <p>Cancer InFocus draws information on Superfund sites from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sems-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS)</a> and information on facilities releasing known carcinogens from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/enviro/tri-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toxic Release Inventory</a>. Superfund site data is available in real-time; the most recently available Toxic Release Inventory data is from 2021.

    <h4><a href="https://data.hrsa.gov/data/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (HRSA), Department of Health &amp; Human Services</a></h4>

    <p>HRSA programs provide health care to people who are geographically isolated, economically or medically vulnerable. This includes people living with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women, mothers and their families, and those otherwise unable to access high quality health care. HRSA also supports access to health care in rural areas, the training of health professionals, the distribution of providers to areas where they are needed most, and improvements in health care delivery.</p>

    <p>Cancer InFocus uses facility data for Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), FQHC Look-a-Likes (FQHC LAL), Rural Health Clinics (RHC), and Correctional Facility clinics. All of these facilities fall under the general classification of Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) facilities. This data is available in real-time, reflecting all such facilities currently recognized by HRSA.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Lung-Cancer-Screening-Resources/LCS-Locator-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lung Cancer Screening Registry (LCSR), American College of Radiology</a></h4>

    <p>The ACR Lung Cancer Screening Registry (LCSR) is designed to systematically audit the quality of interpretation of screening lung CT exams. The registry is based on the ACR Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS), which is the product of the ACR Lung Cancer Screening Committee subgroup on Lung-RADS. This Lung-RADS system is a quality assurance tool designed to standardize lung cancer screening CT reporting and management recommendations, reduce confusion in lung cancer screening CT interpretations and facilitate outcome monitoring. The ACR LCSR will capture Lung-RADS recommendations and monitor and compare appropriate use of Lung-RADS</p>

    <p>Cancer InFocus uses the location data for Lung Cancer Screening Sites from the LCSR. This data is available in real-time, reflecting active lung cancer screening locations in the LCSR. </p>

    <p><em>Note: Not all lung cancer screening sites are required to be a part of the LCSR. The ACR estimates that the LCSR reflects between 80%-90% of all active sites in the nation.</em></p>

    <h4><a href="https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Plan &amp; Provider Enumeration System (NPPES)</a></h4>

    <p>Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services&nbsp;CMS has developed the NPPES to assign unique identifiers to health care providers. The National Provider Indentifier (NPI) has been the standard identifier for all HIPAA-covered entities (health care providers) since May 23, 2007. Small health plans were required to obtain and use an NPI by May 23, 2008.</p>

    <p>Cancer InFocus uses the location data for gastroenterologists and colon &amp; rectal surgeons from the NPPES. This data is available in real-time, reflecting all practicing providers.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/consumer-information-mqsa/search-certified-facility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a></h4>

    <p>The Mammography Quality Standards Act requires mammography facilities across the nation to meet uniform quality standards. Congress passed this law in 1992 to assure high-quality mammography for early breast cancer detection, which can lead to early treatment, a range of treatment options, and increased chances of survival. Under the law, all mammography facilities must: 1) be accredited by an FDA-approved accreditation body, 2) be certified by FDA, or its State, as meeting the standards, 3) undergo an annual MQSA inspection, and 4) prominently display the certificate issued by the agency.</p>

    <p>Cancer InFocus uses the location data for Mammography Sites from the FDA Certified Mammography Facilities list. This data is updated on a weekly basis to reflect real-time presence of mammography facilities.</p>
