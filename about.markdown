<p><span class='largeFirstWords'>Health Data at Scale Collaboratory </span> is a group of researchers focused on uncovering linkages between multiple levels of exposures and health or disease. From neighborhoods to nucleotides, we are interested in understanding how various contexts influence our behaviors, health outcomes, biomarkers, and omics. We utilize diverse methodologies for our research including geospatial analytics, data science, machine learning/artificial intelligence, systems science, qualitative methods, and mixtures analysis.</p>


<p>We established the Collaboratory in 2017 at University of California San Diego. In 2021 the lab moved to the Beckman Research Institute at the City of Hope. We are always interested in discussing collaborations and partnerships - please feel free to reach out with questions, collaboration ideas, or work inquiries.</p>
